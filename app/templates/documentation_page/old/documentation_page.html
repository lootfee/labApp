								<li>This procedure describes the quantitative determination of albumin in human serum and plasma. (Test name on analyzer: ALB2).</li>
								<li>Hyperalbuminemia is of little diagnostic significance except in the case of dehydration. Hypoalbuminemia occurs during many illnesses and is caused by several factors: compromised synthesis due either to liver disease or as a consequence of reduced protein uptake; elevated catabolism due to tissue damage (severe burns) or inflammation; malabsorption of amino acids (Crohn’s disease); proteinuria as a consequence of nephrotic syndrome; protein loss via the stool (neoplastic disease). In severe cases of hypoalbuminemia, the maximum albumin concentration of plasma is 2.5 g/dL (380 µmol/L). Due to the low osmotic pressure of the plasma, water permeates through blood capillaries into tissue (edema).</li>
								<li>The determination of albumin allows monitoring of a controlled patient dietary supplementation and serves also as an excellent test of liver function.</li>

								<li>At a pH of 4.1, albumin displays a sufficiently cationic character to be able to bind with bromcresol green (BCG), an anionic dye, to form a blue-green complex. The color intensity of the blue-green color is directly proportional to the albumin concentration  in  the sample and is measured photometrically.</li>

							You can declare a variable in three ways:
							<p>
								With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax can be used to
								declare both
								local and global variables.
							</p>
							<p>
								By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a
								global
								variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
							</p>
							<p>
								With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax can be used to
								declare a
								block
								scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
							</p>
						</article>
					</section>
					<section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
						<header>Variable scope</header>
						<article>
							<p> When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because
								it is
								available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
								function,
								it
								is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>

							<p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
								declared
								within
								a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
								example the
								following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within
								which x
								is
								declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
							<code>if (true) {
								var x = 5;
								}
								console.log(x); // 5</code>
							<p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>

							<code>if (true) {
								let y = 5;
								}
								console.log(y);
								// ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>

					<section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
						<header>Global variables</header>
						<article>
							<p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object
								is
								window,
								so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>

							<p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
								window or
								frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber
								is
								declared
								in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
						</article>
					</section>
					<section class="main-section" id="Constants">
						<header>Constants</header>
						<article>
							<p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
								identifier is
								the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar
								sign and
								can
								contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>

							<code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
							<p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is
								running. It
								has
								to be initialized to a value.</p>

							<p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the
								const
								keyword
								is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>

							<p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.
								For
								example:</p>

							<code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
								function f() {};
								const f = 5;
								// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO
								function f() {
								const g = 5;
								var g;
								//statements
								}</code>
							However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
							problems.
							<code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};
								MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

					<section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
						<header>Data types</header>
						<article>
							<p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
							<li><p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
									<li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive,
										null is
										not
										the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
									</li>
									<li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
									<li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
									<li>String. "Howdy"</li>
									<li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and
										immutable.
									</li>
								</ul>
							<li>and Object</li>
							Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful
							functions
							with
							your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You
							can
							think
							of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can
							perform.

					<section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
						<header>if...else statement</header>
						<article>
							Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional
							else clause
							to
							execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

							<code>if (condition) {
								statement_1;
								} else {
								statement_2;
								}</code>
							condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation
							of what
							evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
							statement_2
							is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if
							statements.
							<p>
								You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in
								sequence,
								as
								follows:
							</p>
							<code>if (condition_1) {
								statement_1;
								} else if (condition_2) {
								statement_2;
								} else if (condition_n) {
								statement_n;
								} else {
								statement_last;
								} </code>
							In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will
							be
							executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
							general,
							it's
							good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

							<code>if (condition) {
								statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
								statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
								} else {
								statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
								statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
								}</code>
							It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the
							assignment can be
							confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
							<code>if (x = y) {
								/* statements here */
								}</code>
							If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
							additional
							parentheses around the assignment. For example:

							<code>if ((x = y)) {
								/* statements here */
								}</code>

					<section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
						<header>while statement</header>
						<article>
							A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A
							while
							statement looks as follows:

							<code>while (condition)
								statement</code>
							If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
							the
							statement following the loop.

							<p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns
								true,
								statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false,
								execution
								stops
								and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>

							<p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those
								statements.</p>

							Example:

							<p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

							<code>var n = 0;
								var x = 0;
								while (n < 3) {
								n++;
								x += n;
								}</code>
							<p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take
								on the
								following values:</p>

							<li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
							<li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
							<li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
							<p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt 3 is no longer true, so the loop
								terminates.</p>

					<section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
						<header>Function declarations</header>
						<article>
							A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of
							the
							function
							keyword, followed by:

							<li>The name of the function.</li>
							<li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
							<li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
							<p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</P>

							<code>function square(number) {
								return number * number;
								}</code>
							<p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement
								that
								says
								to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
								statement
								specifies the value returned by the function.
							</p>
							<code>return number * number;</code>
							<p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed
								to the
								function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not
								reflected
								globally
								or in the calling function.</p>
