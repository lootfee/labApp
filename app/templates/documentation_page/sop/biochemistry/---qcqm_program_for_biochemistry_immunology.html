												<ol class="list-sub-group">
													<li>A complete and current copy of the procedure manual is available at all times to the staff in the Biochemistry and Immunology Sections. This manual is written substantially based on the NCCLS GP2-A2 (1992) guidelines. A soft copy of all procedures are also accessible from the PHDB1 network drive.</li>
													<li>The procedure manual must be reviewed or revised at least annually or whenever a new procedure is incorporated or modified.  Documentation of annual review is reflected by the signatures of both the pathologist in charge and the laboratory manager.</li>
													<li>A copy of the <a href="">NCCLS GP2-A2 (1992)</a> is available in the Section to be used by all personnel involved in the preparation/revision of the Biochemistry procedures.</li>
													<li>All new Biochemistry and Immunology staff must undertake an extensive training/orientation period for up to 3 months.  This is documented by a <a href="#">checklist</a> which covers all tests/procedures covered in this training/orientation period.</li>
													<li>All technical staff working in the section shall read/review the <a href="#">procedure manual</a> at least annually, in order to stay current on all procedures including new and/or revised procedures.  This is documented by signing a statement to that effect located in front of the manual.</li>
													<li>Yearly assessment verification shall be performed on all staff.  This is done by the supervisor to ensure that the technologist skills and competency level have been evaluated and are concurrent with the expected performance level as per established procedures and quality control guidelines.</li>
													<li>When a procedure is discontinued or revised, a copy of the old procedure must be filed and kept in the Section Supervisor’s Office for at least 2 years, together with the date in which the procedure was put to use and the date in which it was retired.</li>
													<li>In the event that the pathologist is changed or left, the procedure manual must be promptly reviewed and re-approved by the new pathologist.</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li>Patient Preparation Identification
												<ol class="list-sub-group">
													<li>These guidelines apply when a patient arrives at the laboratory for collection of the specimen.</li>
													<li>The phlebotomist asks the patient to state his/her full name and date of birth. Do not ask a question answerable by yes or no (e.g. “Is your name John Smith?” Instead, ask questions such as “May I have your full name and date of birth, please?” </li>
